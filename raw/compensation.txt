+/h2{Comparisons with Similar Situations}

The most important informatilon in negotiations involves
comparisons with similar employment situations.  The most
persuasive comparisons begin with an explanation of why 
they are appropriate. 

+/p
In choosing a comparator  I take these things into consideration:

+/ul
geographic location
+/li
size
+/li
type of employer
+/li
source of income
+/li
customer base 
-/ul

Although wages are of utmost importance, there are
many other considerations.  For example the costs
of union requests for benefits or working conditions.

+/p
Without the help of professional with substantial education and experience 
to handle these details, expensive mistakes are likely.
