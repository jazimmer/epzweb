+/h2{Contract's Total Cost}

The total cost of a contract is of utmost importance to the
employer.  My experience allows me to calculate
such things as

+/ul
The cost difference between allowing overtime on Sundays
versus the seventh working day.
+/li
What is the actual cost of allowing an additional week of
vacation time?
+/li
How do particular changes in work rules affect the total cost?
+/li
What is employee turnover costing?
+/li
What is the cost difference between particular changes to the night
shift against offering a premium for weekend work?
+/li
Are possible savings in a better contract worth holding
up what's on the table now?
-/ul

Working with me can provide you with more than just a report
but also the ability to adapt to proposals being considered
during negotiations.
