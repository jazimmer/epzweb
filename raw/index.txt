Labor negotiations depend on numbers.   Many things must be
taken into consideration including (but not limited to) wages, benefits, and inflation.

+/p For those things and others you need an outside expert. I am a

with

helping such organizations as the
Massachusetts Bay Transport Authority and the Massachusetts
Port Authority.

My services generally fall ilnto three categories:

of wages and benefits with similar groups of employees.

For some clients I have a long-term relationships as the sole number
   cruncher and economist.  For others I have completed short
   term projects with narrow goals.  Whatever your needs are,
   I can adapt and you will get a complete compensation
analysis with a clear summary.
